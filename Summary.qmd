On these data, the best regression model to  given the predictors was the random forests model. It provides the lowest MSE value of 0.02992 while still explaining more than 80% of the variation in the model, and demonstrated a reasonable balance between bias and flexibility. To decrease prediction error, we found we had to sacrifice some of the power of the model: for example, the best multiple linear regression model explained over 90% of the variance, however, because we are handling medical data, accurate predictions are of the utmost importance. All three models demonstrate the importance of including the number of cases of heart disease as a predictor of the number of deaths. After controlling for heart disease cases, the next more significant factor was found to be hospital ranking, then the number of hospitals in a region. Demographic variable associations with heart disease deaths were weak or absent, which was surprising to the researchers and would be a good opportunity for further research. Understanding why demographic information did not make a difference, which was an assumption of the research team, would be pressing for future medical studies.
