Here we are working on a basic multiple linear model with cross validation. 

Importing data
```{r}
library(tidyverse); theme_set(theme_bw())
reg_data_long <- read_csv(".\\..\\..\\Data\\reg_data_long.csv")
head(reg_data_long)
reg_data_long$female_prop <- reg_data_long$FemalePop/reg_data_long$TotalPop

```

Question: Can mortality rate from heart disease per 1000 people be predicted from demographic conditions (such as healthcare funding or median income) within counties in California?

To start, we will employ a series of multiple regressions to get a better understanding of the relationships at play and which variables are most useful in predicting the mortality rate from heart disease.
